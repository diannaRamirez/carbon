# Dynamically set floating styles

Carbon library currently utilitizes the `@floating-ui` library to handle the
dynamic positioning of floating elements to their trigger / anchor element and
collision detection. In the majority of cases, the dynamic positioning of
elements with the `@floating-ui` 'fixed' strategy will prevent clipping.

The 'enable-v12-dynamic-floating-styles' flag can be used if the dynamic styles
is needed but the collision detection is not desired.

**Note**: If the `autoAlign` prop is used, the feature flag won't be necessary
as the collision detection includes the dynamic styles logic.

## Enable dynamic setting of floating styles

```js
<FeatureFlags
  flags={{
    'enable-v12-dynamic-floating-styles': true,
  }}>
  <Popover open={open}>
    <button
      type="button"
      onClick={() => {
        setOpen(!open);
      }}>
      Toggle
    </button>
    <PopoverContent>
      The content that is revealed by interacting with the Toggle button
    </PopoverContent>
  </Popover>
</FeatureFlags>
```
